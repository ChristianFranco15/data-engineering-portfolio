# Using MapReduce to Analyze Wikipedia Pages

This project will demonstrate how to analyze data scraped from Wikipedia pages by creating a simple MapReduce framework to analyze the data more quickly and efficiently. We will also implement a simplified version of the `grep` command-line utility to search for specific instances of strings.
