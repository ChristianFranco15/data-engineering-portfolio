# Data Engineering Portfolio

This repository contains a portfolio of data engineering projects which are presented mainly in the form of Jupyter Notebooks. Clicking on the title of a project will link you directly to the project notebook itself.

## Projects

## [Hacker News Pipeline][p1]

[p1]: https://github.com/ChristianFranco15/data-engineering-portfolio/blob/main/Hacker%20News%20Pipeline/hacker_news_pipeline.ipynb

This project will demonstrate how to create a simple pipeline to return the top Hacker News stories from 2014 using JSON data. We will also create a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) from scratch that will be used to run basic natural language processing tasks from this pipeline.

## [Building Database for Crime Reports][p2]

[p2]: https://github.com/ChristianFranco15/data-engineering-portfolio/blob/main/Building%20Database%20for%20Crime%20Reports/building_database_for_crime_reports.ipynb

This project will demonstrate how to create a database in PostgreSQL with crimes data. It will also demonstrate how to load the data into a table using the correct datatypes. Finally, we will show how to create users and groups in PostgreSQL and grant them specific privileges.

## [Creating a Key-Value Store][p3]

[p3]: https://github.com/ChristianFranco15/data-engineering-portfolio/blob/main/Creating%20Key-Value%20Store/creating_key_value_store.ipynb

This project will demonstrate how to create a simple and flexible key-value store from scratch that works similarly to a Python dictionary. The key-value store will be created using a B-tree data structure and it will be able to perform range queries.

## [Evaluating Numerical Expressions][p4]

[p4]: https://github.com/ChristianFranco15/data-engineering-portfolio/blob/main/Evaluating%20Numerical%20Expressions/evaluating_numerical_expressions.ipynb

This project will demonstrate how to implement a stack using a linked list to create an algorithm that evaluates numerical expressions. We will also use the Shunting yard algorithm to parse infix expressions so that we can evaluate them more easily using postfix notation.

## [Using MapReduce to Analyze Wikipedia Pages][p5]

[p5]: https://github.com/ChristianFranco15/data-engineering-portfolio/blob/main/Using%20MapReduce%20to%20Analyze%20Wikipedia%20Pages/analyzing_wiki_pages.ipynb

This project will demonstrate how to analyze data scraped from Wikipedia pages by creating a simple MapReduce framework to analyze the data more quickly and efficiently. We will also implement a simplified version of the `grep` command-line utility to search for specific instances of strings.

## [Optimizing DataFrames and Processing in Chunks][p6]

[p6]: https://github.com/ChristianFranco15/data-engineering-portfolio/blob/main/Optimizing%20DataFrames%20and%20Processing%20in%20Chunks/data_optimization_and_processing_example.ipynb

This project will demonstrate how to load a large dataset by optimizing and processing it in chunks. For this we will use a dataset from Lending Club of loans that were approved from 2007-2011. We will focus particularly on memory usage optimization by using chunks to load in the data and then converting columns into more efficient data types.

## [Answering Business Questions Using SQL][p7]

[p7]: https://github.com/ChristianFranco15/data-engineering-portfolio/blob/main/Business%20Questions%20With%20SQL/answering_business_questions_sql.ipynb

This project explores a sample database called Chinook, which holds information about a digital media store. This database contains 11 tables about albums, tracks, customers, employees, invoices, and more. We will use this database to answer business questions using advanced SQL queries in Python.

## [Building Fast Queries on a CSV][p8]

[p8]: https://github.com/ChristianFranco15/data-engineering-portfolio/blob/main/Building%20Fast%20Queries%20on%20a%20CSV/laptop_queries.ipynb

This project explores a dataset on laptop prices containing about 1300 models. It will also explore different time complexities and how to optimize functions to make queries on the dataset faster.
