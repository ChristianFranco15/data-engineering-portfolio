# Optimizng DataFrames and Processing in Chunks

This project will demonstrate how to load a large dataset by optimizing and processing it in chunks. For this we will use a dataset from Lending Club of loans that were approved from 2007-2011. We will focus particularly on memory usage optimization by using chunks to load in the data and then converting columns into more efficient data types.
